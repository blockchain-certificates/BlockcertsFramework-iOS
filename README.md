# Blockcerts Framework for iOS
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blockchain-certificates/BlockcertsFramework-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blockchain-certificates/BlockcertsFramework-iOS.svg?branch=master)

This repository contains the core modules used to implement Blockcerts functionality in iOS. 

## Archive a build for TestFlight
Here's what you need to do to distribute a new build on TestFlight:

1. Update the build number on master.
    ```
    agvtool bump -all
    ```
2. Commit & push your version bump commit to master.

    ```
    git commit -am "Version bump to ###"
    git push
    ```
3. In Xcode, select Generic iOS Device. Then select Product > Archive
4. Once it's archived, click the big blue "Upload to App Store" button. Don't worry -- this just uploads your build to Apple. It doesn't actually submit it for publishing in the App Store.
5. Follow [these instructions](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/BetaTestingTheApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH35) for updating the metadata & sending out the build to TestFlight testers
